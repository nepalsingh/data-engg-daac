Azure Databricks managed resource group

Overview:
When you create an Azure Databricks workspace, Azure automatically creates a managed resource group in your subscription. This resource group contains resources required for the operation of your Databricks workspace, such as network interfaces and storage accounts.

Key Points:

Automatic Creation: The managed resource group is created by Azure Databricks during workspace deployment. You don't need to create it manually.
Naming Convention: The name usually follows the pattern databricks-rg-<workspace-name>-<random-string>.
Permissions: Ensure that the user or service principal deploying the workspace has the necessary permissions to create resources in your subscription, including the managed resource group.
Management: Do not modify or delete resources within this group directly. These resources are managed by Azure Databricks and changes might affect the stability of your workspace.
For more detailed information, including best practices and security considerations, please refer to the official documentation linked above.
