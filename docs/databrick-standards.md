1. Cluster Standard:
Dynamic Scaling: Configure clusters to auto-scale based on workload demands. This ensures optimal resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.
Right-Sizing: Adjust cluster sizes according to workload requirements to avoid underutilization or over-provisioning.
Instance Types: Choose appropriate instance types based on the workload characteristics (e.g., memory-intensive, CPU-intensive).
Spot Instances: Utilize spot instances for non-critical workloads to reduce costs, while ensuring that critical workloads run on regular instances.
Cluster Policies: Implement policies for automatic cluster termination during periods of inactivity to further optimize costs.
High Availability: Configure clusters for high availability to ensure uninterrupted service in case of node failures or other issues.
2. Notebook Standard:
Version Control: Integrate notebooks with version control systems like Git for tracking changes and collaboration among team members.
Documentation: Include descriptive markdown cells in notebooks to explain the purpose of the code, provide context, and document any assumptions or decisions.
Parameterization: Parameterize notebooks to make them reusable and adaptable to different scenarios or datasets.
Structured Code: Write well-structured and modular code within notebooks to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability.
Performance Optimization: Optimize notebook code for performance by minimizing data shuffling, leveraging caching, and avoiding unnecessary computations.
Testing: Test notebook code thoroughly, especially for complex or critical workflows, to identify and address potential issues early.
3. Security Standard:
Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities based on users' roles and permissions.
Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
Audit Logging: Enable audit logging to track user activities and system events for compliance, troubleshooting, and security analysis purposes.
Network Security: Configure network security settings to restrict inbound and outbound traffic, implement firewalls, and isolate sensitive workloads.
Data Masking: Apply data masking techniques to obfuscate sensitive information in notebooks or query results to prevent unauthorized exposure.
Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by implementing appropriate security controls and practices.
Regular Updates: Keep Databricks clusters, notebooks, and associated libraries up-to-date with security patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.
These standards and best practices help ensure that Databricks clusters are configured optimally for performance and cost-efficiency, notebooks are developed and used effectively for data analysis and model development, and security measures are in place to protect data and infrastructure.
